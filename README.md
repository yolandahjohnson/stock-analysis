# All Stocks Analysis 2017 and 2018

## Project Overview

Steve is manageing his parents stock portfolio. They are passsionate about green energy and want to invest in DAQO New Energy Corporation (DQ). They have not done any research on DQ and simply chose it because they met many years ago at Dairy Queen. Another DQ. Steve's goal is to do a thorough analysis of DQ as well as other green energy stocks so that he can diversify his parents portfolio. 

Steve likes the work I have done so far to analyize a few dozen stocks but would like to see how the analysis of thousands of stocks would work. Utilizing refactoring code, my goal is to make the code more efficient by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.
